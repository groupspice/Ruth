<noscript> Ruth￼￼￼￼Study NotesThe period of the Judges: Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, the land the Lord had promised to their ancestors. The Lord promised to enable them to overcome the corrupt Canaanites if they stayed faithful to the Lord. But their faith was  ckle. They were drawn to the Canaanite gods. So for several centuries the Lord continually let enemies conquer the Israelites when they were faithless, and then when they prayed to him, he sent “judges” to lead them in warfare against their enemies and then to govern them after the victory. Thus, much of Israel experienced turmoil during this period. Judah (the tribe of Elimelech and Naomi) seems to have been more stable than the other tribes, and we see no signs of war in the book of Ruth. However, the theme of moving from turmoil to rest does run through Ruth’s story.Widow: Women of that time were not allowed to get paid work as hired laborers. Also, Naomi was allowed to inherit Elimelech’s property (4:3), but custom didn’t let her farm it without a male relative in charge, so all she could do was sell it. Thus, a woman’s livelihood depended on male family members. Also, her worth in society depended on her having sons. A widow whose sons were dead was defenseless, vulnerable, and worthless in others’ eyes.Orpah’s people and gods: Family and tradition were everything in the ancient world. Orpah may have had a chance at remarrying within her own kin network, but her chance of  nding a husband in Israel was tiny. Israelites looked down on Moabites, and the children of an Israelite and a Moabite might even be treated as a foreigner and not a member of God’s people (Deut. 23:3–6). What Israelite man would marry a foreign widow with no property if he had enough going for him to win an Israelite virgin as his bride?24 </noscript>
