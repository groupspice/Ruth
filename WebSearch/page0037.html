<noscript> Leader’s Notesgroup understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a person’s life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the ses- sion or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two A Woman of Humility and FaithfulnessGrowing3. The Law of Moses was revolutionary in ancient times for its concern, not simply for the wealthy and powerful, but also for the least powerful: the poor, immigrants, widows, orphans. The Law of Moses expected people to act with justice and even generosity toward those who had less. It rejected the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but not for others.4. Ruth is a great example of sel essness here, because upon  nding herself in a vulnerable position (woman, widow, immigrant, poor), she could have returned to the security of her own family but chose instead to stay by Naomi’s side, serving her, providing for her by gleaning the  elds. Even this gleaning she did in humility, saying, “In whose eyes I shall  nd favor”—not saying with pride, “I’ll go and not be denied my rights.”82 </noscript>
