<noscript> Leader’s Notes5. Widows couldn’t work for money, so they faced starvation unless they remarried or received the protection of a male relative. They were looked down on socially, and they were vulnerable to exploitation.6. Naomi sees the deaths of her husband and sons as a iction from God’s hand for moving to Moab and remaining there too long (v. 13). She believes she is being punished. When she hears that “the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food” (v. 6), she immediately decides to return home. She refers to her life as bitter (vv. 13, 20) and empty (v. 21), and goes so far as asking that she be called Mara, which means “bitter.”7. Answers will vary here. Naomi is bitter and full of self-pity, but many will  nd her feelings understandable given the severity of her loss. Some readers will think she’s right that God is punishing her, while others will see that God’s ultimate plan for Naomi is for restoration, not just punishment for her failings.9. Option #1: They could return to the security of their own families, to their own gods, and to the hope of a husband. Option #2: They could continue with Naomi toward a future of uncertainty. The uncertainty and the likeli- hood of hardship make Ruth’s choice di cult. While Orpah’s goodbye kiss says, “I love you,” her subsequent actions communicate, “but not enough to endure what following you to Judah might bring.” Ruth, on the other hand, demonstrates her love and faithfulness to Naomi.10. Ruth is a person who is willing to pay the price of commitment. Her  rst commitment is to Naomi, but she speaks of the Lord as well. It’s hard to know how much she knows about him at this point, but she chooses him.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.15. Spiritual partners will pair up during group time and/or through the week and use the Personal Health Plan to record plans and progress throughout our study of Ruth. For many, spiritual partners will be a new idea, but we highly encourage you to try them for this study. It’s hard to start a spiritual practice like prayer or consistent Bible reading with no support. A friend makes a huge di erence.We recommend that men partner with men and women partner with women. Partners can check in with each other weekly either during your group meetings or outside the meeting. As leader, you may want to prayer- fully decide who would be a good match with whom. Try to discern who might have good relational chemistry that may lead to a deeper connection. Remind people that this partnership isn’t forever; it’s just for a few weeks. Be sure to have extra copies of the Personal Health Plan available at this80 </noscript>
