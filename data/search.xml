        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on Ruth. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of com- mitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overempha- size one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstRarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, min- istry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encourage- ment in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: Ruth Video Teaching DVD compan- ion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Joanne Jung. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstGROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group sessionwill give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and 11]]></text>

If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONBefore the age of  fty-one, Abraham Lincoln lost his job, failed in business and was defeated for legislature, speaker, elector, con- gress, senate, and vice president; his sweetheart and three of his four sons died; and he had a nervous breakdown. This is not the kind of track record to inspire a man toward greatness. Thankfully, the story doesn’t end there.Lincoln went on to become the sixteenth president of the United States, best known for abolishing slavery through the Emancipa- tion Proclamation and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. The e ects of his presidency are still felt today in US life and politics. His life personi ed values such as honesty, integrity, courage, and perseverance. Historians have ranked him among the greatest of American presidents.Like Lincoln, we will face di culties as we travel through life. This is guaranteed! While we may not be able to control all situa- tions, we can control what we do through them. We can allow them to defeat us, or we can, with the help of Jesus Christ, stand  rm as men and women of courage, persevere, and come out shining examples of victory.Ruth’s unmatched commitment to her mother-in-law Naomi and her God establishes for us a pattern for unwavering, resolute faith in Christ. We must take up his cross and carry it willingly, making a solemn promise to allow nothing to separate us from him. This commitment requires faithfulness, courage, and bold action. But with absolute and complete reliance upon the Lord, we can stand  rm until the end as Ruth did.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONECONTEXT AND STORYLINE MEMORY VERSE: Be on guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong (1 Cor. 16:13NLT).Geo rey parks his car in the same lot as I. We greet each other whenever our paths cross. His walk to the closest building is shorter than mine, as the blue handicap logo on his license plate provides for easier access. He maneuvers his forearm crutches that allow him to make his way to his classes at the seminary. Diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was a year old, the spastic muscles have overpowered those that are weaker in his legs, limiting his mobility and physical activity. Through Geo rey’s weaknesses, God demonstrates his un- fathomable grace, developing character through the struggles. These have taught Geo rey to trust God more completely. He is con dent in God’s trustworthiness. Geo rey says that “God working through me is a picture of his character, and because God expresses his na- ture through my limitations, he is more fully known.” Our ability to trust God is proportional to our understanding that the su ering he permits is couched in his divine purposes. It is that God-given ability to honor commitments when honoring them becomes di cult. Both Naomi and Ruth exercise that ability.17]]></text>

Pray that your group will gain an understanding of your faith journeys through this study of a woman who showed faithful- ness in a world of compromise.As you begin, take time to pass around a sheet of paper on which to write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Or pass around one of your study guides opened to the Small Group Roster. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this Deepening Life Together: Ruth small group study and what you expect to learn during the next few weeks.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values we’ve found most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. We recommend that you review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have room to grow in—to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.3. When have you or someone you know faced a circumstance that appeared hopeless at  rst but later turned out exceedingly wonderful?18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[GROWING45–50 min.Context and StorylineNaomi, her husband, and her sons were Israelites. They were sup- posed to be committed to the Lord, Israel’s God. They lived in Beth- lehem in the land the Lord promised to their ancestors. The Lord’s law urged them to trust him in hard times and forbade Israelites to marry women from pagan Moab (Deut. 23:3). But this was the pe- riod of the Judges, when “Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw  t” (Judg. 21:25). Famine struck the Promised Land, and Naomi’s family moved to Moab. This decision had consequences not only for them but for all Israel.Take turns reading Ruth 1 aloud.4. What happened in Naomi’s life during the decade described in verses 1–5?5. Read the Study Notes for this session. How do these notes help you understand the dire situation Naomi and her daughters- in-law were facing?6. How did Naomi react to her su ering (vv. 13, 20–21)?7. An Israelite reader would know that Elimelech’s faith in the Lord was weak—instead of seeking refuge from the famine within Israel, he took his family to Moab and even let his sons marry pagans. What do you think we’re meant to think about Naomi? For instance, are we meant to feel sad for her, see her troubles as the result of her weak faith—or what?Have you ever experienced severe loss or su ering as Naomi did? If so, how have you dealt with it? If not, how does that a ect the way you respond to Naomi?8. In verses 8–10, Naomi insists that her two daughters-in-law stay in their homeland. What does Orpah and Ruth’s initial response suggest about their relationship to Naomi?19]]></text>

Ultimately, Orpah chose to return to the security of her mother’s home and the gods of Moab (v. 15). Ruth chose di erently. What do you learn about Ruth as a person from verses 15–17?From what you see in the text, does it seem that Ruth is com- mitted to the Lord, or simply to Naomi? What makes you think that?11. When have you had to make a hard decision in di cult cir- cumstances? What did you do?How did your faith (strong, weak, or nonexistent) a ect your decision?12. How would you compare your commitment to the Lord with Ruth’s commitment to Naomi (vv.16–18)?13. What are some of the things in life today that make it easier to be like Orpah than like Ruth?What helps us become more like Ruth?Ruth’s unmatched commitment to Naomi establishes for us a pattern for unwavering, resolute faith in Christ. We must accept Jesus as our Lord; we must invest in his people, loving without con- dition; we must willingly endure the su ering he puts in our path and serve him within it; and we must make it our solemn promise to allow nothing, including death, to separate us from him. This is not a commitment entered into lightly. We must carefully count the cost. It requires faithfulness, courage, and bold action. But with absolute and complete reliance upon the Lord, we can stand  rm until the end.20]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[DEVELOPING10 min.Context and StorylineRomans 12:4–5 reads, “Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.” God has designed each of us uniquely—with in- dividual talents, abilities, passions, and experiences that determine which “part” we perform in the body of Christ. In order to begin this journey of discovering how God made us, it’s important to be sure that we live consistently and honestly.14. Naomi and Ruth both demonstrate a marked faithfulness to God and remarkable integrity to their faith. One way that we can ensure that our lives agree with the faith we profess is through spiritual accountability. We strongly recommend each of you partner with someone in the group to help you in your spiritual journey during this study. This person will be your spiritual partner for the next several weeks. He or she doesn’t have to be your best friend but will simply encourage you to complete the goals you set for yourself during this study. Fol- lowing through on a resolution is tough when you’re on your own, but we’ve found it makes all the di erence to have a partner cheering us on. See the Leader’s Notes for instructions for establishing spiritual partners.15. In the Appendix we’ve provided a Personal Health Plan, a chart for keeping track of your spiritual progress. You and your spiri- tual partner can use it for accountability to the goals you set for yourselves. See the Personal Health Plan for instructions. If time permits, complete the Connect and Grow questions of your Personal Health Plan and share your answers with your spiritual partner.SHARING 10 min.Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help unbelievers connect with him, to know him personally. As Christians, we are his disciples and we too should be helping others connect with him.21]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Context and Storylinet Consider inviting a friend to attend a weekend church ser- vice with you and possibly plan to enjoy a meal together afterward. This can be a great opportunity to talk with someone about your faith in Jesus.t Is there someone who is unable to attend your group but who still needs a connection? Would you be willing to have lunch or co ee with that person, catch up on life, and share something you’ve learned from this study? Jesus doesn’t call all of us to lead small groups, but he does call every disciple to spiritually multiply his or her life over time.SURRENDERING 10 min.Ruth fully committed her life to Naomi and her God. Her commit- ment can help us see what it means to surrender our lives to our Lord and then act on it.17. In question 12, you were asked to explore the depth of Ruth’s commitment to Naomi and relate it to your own relation- ship to Jesus. If you felt the Holy Spirit convict you that your relationship lacked depth of commitment in any way, spend a few minutes in prayer asking God for forgiveness and then ask him to renew your heart with a faith that is fully devoted to him and able to stand up against anything that life brings.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. At the end of each session, we have provided Re ections for you to begin daily time with him. There are  ve daily Scrip- ture readings with room to record your thoughts. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning and help you develop the habit of time alone with God throughout the week. On the sixth day there is a place to record your summary of the  ve re ections.19. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.23]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[RuthStudy NotesThe period of the Judges: Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, the land the Lord had promised to their ancestors. The Lord promised to enable them to overcome the corrupt Canaanites if they stayed faithful to the Lord. But their faith was  ckle. They were drawn to the Canaanite gods. So for several centuries the Lord continually let enemies conquer the Israelites when they were faithless, and then when they prayed to him, he sent “judges” to lead them in warfare against their enemies and then to govern them after the victory. Thus, much of Israel experienced turmoil during this period. Judah (the tribe of Elimelech and Naomi) seems to have been more stable than the other tribes, and we see no signs of war in the book of Ruth. However, the theme of moving from turmoil to rest does run through Ruth’s story.Widow: Women of that time were not allowed to get paid work as hired laborers. Also, Naomi was allowed to inherit Elimelech’s property (4:3), but custom didn’t let her farm it without a male relative in charge, so all she could do was sell it. Thus, a woman’s livelihood depended on male family members. Also, her worth in society depended on her having sons. A widow whose sons were dead was defenseless, vulnerable, and worthless in others’ eyes.Orpah’s people and gods: Family and tradition were everything in the ancient world. Orpah may have had a chance at remarrying within her own kin network, but her chance of  nding a husband in Israel was tiny. Israelites looked down on Moabites, and the children of an Israelite and a Moabite might even be treated as a foreigner and not a member of God’s people (Deut. 23:3–6). What Israelite man would marry a foreign widow with no property if he had enough going for him to win an Israelite virgin as his bride?24]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the  rst night of our group?Like all fun things in life—have a party! A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch53]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked Questionsrelationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.54]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, co-leader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.72]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Context and StorylineConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to take time to connect at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.3. At the end of each Connecting section is an icebreaker question that leads into the Bible study. Ask people to answer in a few sentences and keep the long version of the story for after the group meeting.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public. Be- cause the Bible passages in Ruth are long, you may go around the circle and take turns reading a couple of paragraphs each, but allow people to pass if they prefer not to read aloud.79LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes5. Widows couldn’t work for money, so they faced starvation unless they remarried or received the protection of a male relative. They were looked down on socially, and they were vulnerable to exploitation.6. Naomi sees the deaths of her husband and sons as a iction from God’s hand for moving to Moab and remaining there too long (v. 13). She believes she is being punished. When she hears that “the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food” (v. 6), she immediately decides to return home. She refers to her life as bitter (vv. 13, 20) and empty (v. 21), and goes so far as asking that she be called Mara, which means “bitter.”7. Answers will vary here. Naomi is bitter and full of self-pity, but many will  nd her feelings understandable given the severity of her loss. Some readers will think she’s right that God is punishing her, while others will see that God’s ultimate plan for Naomi is for restoration, not just punishment for her failings.9. Option #1: They could return to the security of their own families, to their own gods, and to the hope of a husband. Option #2: They could continue with Naomi toward a future of uncertainty. The uncertainty and the likeli- hood of hardship make Ruth’s choice di cult. While Orpah’s goodbye kiss says, “I love you,” her subsequent actions communicate, “but not enough to endure what following you to Judah might bring.” Ruth, on the other hand, demonstrates her love and faithfulness to Naomi.10. Ruth is a person who is willing to pay the price of commitment. Her  rst commitment is to Naomi, but she speaks of the Lord as well. It’s hard to know how much she knows about him at this point, but she chooses him.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.15. Spiritual partners will pair up during group time and/or through the week and use the Personal Health Plan to record plans and progress throughout our study of Ruth. For many, spiritual partners will be a new idea, but we highly encourage you to try them for this study. It’s hard to start a spiritual practice like prayer or consistent Bible reading with no support. A friend makes a huge di erence.We recommend that men partner with men and women partner with women. Partners can check in with each other weekly either during your group meetings or outside the meeting. As leader, you may want to prayer- fully decide who would be a good match with whom. Try to discern who might have good relational chemistry that may lead to a deeper connection. Remind people that this partnership isn’t forever; it’s just for a few weeks. Be sure to have extra copies of the Personal Health Plan available at this80]]></text>

It is a good idea for you to look over the Personal Health Plan before the meeting so you can help people understand how to use it.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.16. We provided a Circles of Life diagram for you and the group to use to help you identify people who need to be connected in Christian community. When people are asked why they never go to church, they often say, “No one ever invited me.” Remind the group that our responsibility is to invite people, but we are not responsible for how they respond. Talk to the group about the importance of inviting people; remind them that healthy small groups make a habit of inviting friends, neighbors, unconnected church members, co-workers, etc., to join their groups or join them at a weekend service. When people get connected to a group of new friends, they often join the church.The Circles of Life represent one of the values of the Small Group Agree- ment: “Welcome for Newcomers.” Some groups fear that newcomers will interrupt the intimacy that members have built over time. However, groups generally gain strength with the infusion of new blood. It’s like a river of living water  owing into a stagnant pond. Some groups remain permanently open, while others open periodically, such as at the beginning and ending of a study. Love grows by giving itself away. If your circle becomes too large for easy face-to-face conversations, you can simply form a second discussion circle in another room in your home.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each session will pro- vide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.17. It is very important to ensure that there is adequate time for prayer, so don’t allow this to take more than a minute or two. You can encourage everyone to re ect more on this at a later time, perhaps during their personal time with God.18. This question is meant to encourage quiet time at home each day throughout the week. Here you can help the group see the importance of making time with God a priority.

If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a person’s life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the ses- sion or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two A Woman of Humility and FaithfulnessGrowing3. The Law of Moses was revolutionary in ancient times for its concern, not simply for the wealthy and powerful, but also for the least powerful: the poor, immigrants, widows, orphans. The Law of Moses expected people to act with justice and even generosity toward those who had less. It rejected the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but not for others.4. Ruth is a great example of sel essness here, because upon  nding herself in a vulnerable position (woman, widow, immigrant, poor), she could have returned to the security of her own family but chose instead to stay by Naomi’s side, serving her, providing for her by gleaning the  elds. Even this gleaning she did in humility, saying, “In whose eyes I shall  nd favor”—not saying with pride, “I’ll go and not be denied my rights.”82]]></text>
